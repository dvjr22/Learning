#In Section 6.2, sibling negotiation behaviour was plotted versus arrival
#time for each nest in the owl data. A graph for each nest was created and
#saved as a jpg file. Do the same for the temperature data; see Exercise 4.1 for
#details. The file temperature.xls contains temperature observations made at
#31 locations (denoted as stations in the spreadsheet) along the Dutch coast-
#line. Plot the temperature data versus time for each station, and save the
#graph as a jpg file.

#The owl data were sampled on two consecutive nights. If you select the data
#from one nest, the observations will cover both nights. The two nights differed
#as to the feeding regime (satiated or deprived). To see observations from a single
#night, select all observations from a particular nest and food treatment. Use the
#ifelse and paste functions to make a new categorical variable that defines
#the observations from a single night at a particular nest. Try rerunning the code
#from Exercise 1 to make a graph of sibling negotiation versus arrival time for
#observations of the same nest and night.

#In this exercise we provide the steps for the function that was presented in

#as well (loop), but is less elegant.
